        Nigerian politics is a dynamic and often dramatic landscape, shaped by a
        complex interplay of ethnic diversity, colonial legacies, socio-economic
        challenges, and evolving democratic institutions. As Africa’s most
        populous nation and one of its largest economies, Nigeria’s political
        journey reflects both the promise and the turbulence of
        post-independence governance. Nigeria operates as a federal presidential
        republic, meaning power is shared between the central government and 36
        individual states. The system is modeled loosely on the U.S.
        Constitution, with three distinct branches: the Executive Branch, headed
        by the President who serves as both Head of State and Head of
        Government; the Legislative Branch, consisting of a bicameral National
        Assembly with a Senate and House of Representatives; and the Judicial
        Branch, led by the Supreme Court and supported by lower courts.
        Elections are held every four years and overseen by the Independent
        National Electoral Commission (INEC), though challenges like vote-buying
        and electoral violence persist. Major political parties include the All
        Progressives Congress (APC), currently in power under President Bola
        Ahmed Tinubu; the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), the main opposition;
        and the Labour Party (LP), which gained momentum in recent years,
        especially among youth and urban voters. Nigeria’s ethnic
        diversity—featuring over 250 groups, with Hausa-Fulani in the North,
        Yoruba in the South-West, and Igbo in the South-East—plays a significant
        role in shaping political alliances and voting patterns. Historical
        events such as military coups, the Nigerian Civil War, and the
        transition to democracy in 1999 have left lasting impacts on governance
        and public trust. Key political issues include corruption, insecurity,
        economic reform, and youth engagement, with movements like #EndSARS
        highlighting demands for accountability. Despite challenges like weak
        institutions and voter apathy, Nigeria’s democracy continues to evolve,
        supported by a vibrant civil society and growing digital activism.
